# YT-url-swap
AutoHotKey to replace YouTube default URL with the "embedded" URL (typically used to embed in HTML) and automatically start the video. The "embedded" version allows a larger screen in a window, which is particularly useful when taking notes in a separate window.

Example: Original URL = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FakeLink"; URL post-hotkey = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FakeLink?rel=0&autoplay=1"
